iPhone Health Log and Google Health Integration

...deprecated/abandoned...

Back in the day, I loved Google Health a great deal.  I even wrote this app which integrated with it.

Unfortunately Google wasn't getting a great reception to it, and eventually turned it off.  The idea
of an iOS health tracker that monitored my blood sugar, blood pressure, weight, medicines, food I ate, etc.,
stuck with me, but I never really had the time to fully flesh it out.  I used it for my own purposes, but
it never developed past a point that I could share it with anyone else.

And then iOS 8 came along. :)

The icons are proprietary (purchased from Glyphish).  The code is vaguely interesting; I was learning Objective C,
for the most part, while I was doing this.
